## Brief:
Develop a JavaScript web app that maintains a list of bookmarks (links). The user is able to add/edit/delete any link in the list. The application should only use front-end technologies.

## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, REACT

## Improvements:
- Pagination - This feature has not been added due to time constraints. With more time and investigation I would add this feature.
- CORS policy - The URL validation process makes a request to another domain which
causes a CORS error.
- Favicon Images

## What went well:
- Local storage used to store bookmarks
- Clean UI and interactive elements
- CRUD capabillity
